My course work for the http://introtodeeplearning.com/ at MIT. 

##Here are core concepts

Calculus deals with rates of change that are not constant, Moreover a straight line has one and only one slope; one and only one rate of change. When dealing with non linear functions derivation must be used to calculate the rate of change for multiple points (get all of the slopes for the function curve).

See (https://www.themathpage.com/aCalc/derivative.htm)

##Derivatives 

A way to show rate of change, for a function at one given point. It is also the slope of the tangent line 
on a point of the graph.

#Difference quotient

the limit of the diff quo is equal to the derivative
